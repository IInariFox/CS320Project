# To ensure that my code is functional and secure, I will continue to perform various types of tests and make sure that I am using up-to-date software and follow correct coding methodologies so that it may not lead to problems later down the road.
# To interpret user needs there are a few ways of gathering requirements and understanding the functionality of the system. For example, clear and effective communication between the client and development team is critical for understanding the requirements of client. Greating various diagrams such ase use-case diagrams, functional diagrams, and object models will help the team better understand the work required and software needed to complete the project. To incorporate those needs into the program, developers could implement the functions stated through the various diagrams and models and use various tests to ensure that the code works as intended.
# A great way to approach designing software is to write pseudocode, great various types of models that define the needs of clients, functions needed within the system, and using extensions or APIs to help shorten the development process, escpecially for functions and algorithms that are simplistic or universally required.
